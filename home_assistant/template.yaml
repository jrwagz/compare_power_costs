          We are using the holiday integration to get proper changing of holidays when
          they fall on a weekend. See https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/holiday/

          When a holiday falls on a Saturday or Sunday, the Friday before the holiday (if the
          holiday falls on a Saturday) or the Monday following the holiday (if the holiday falls on
          a Sunday) will be considered a holiday and consequently Off-Peak.
